# Building Archetype Model Database (BAM-DB)
This repostitory documents a set of archetype building desings, designed to modern seismic U.S. codes. Each design contains an OpenSees model for assessing structural performance and FEMA P-58 and ATC-138 models for assessing building loss and downtime risk. The archetypes are designed for a general high seismicity, Dmax, site with a soil class of C and follow the ASCE/SEI 7-16 design provision. The archetype set includes reference models designed to meet minimum base shear and drift requirements as well as enhanced designs that are designed for up to 50% higher strengths and 1% drift limits. Basic properties of each model are contained within the "models.csv" file, with detialed design, model, and response data in subsequent subfolders.
